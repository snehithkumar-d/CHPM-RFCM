City Health Office in Indonesia is creating a health 
report every year, describing the condition of the city 
public health. The report is used as the source of 
determining the city health index. The construction of 
a city health development index is important to 
produce an objective formula. In this study, the 
classification method Random Forest is used to 
developing a proper model for prediction and analysis 
of the health index of a city. The goal of this work is to 
find a prediction model to make a more accurate 
prediction and reducing errors in dealing with the city 
health index. The performance of the model is 
evaluated by using three parameters: Mean Absolute 
Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root 
Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The research shows 
that the model of Random Forest with a 15 percent 
data test by using 200 decision trees gives the best 
results
